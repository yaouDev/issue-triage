# Advanced Issue Triage

[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Marketplace-Advanced%20Issue%20Triage-brightgreen?logo=github)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/advanced-issue-triage)

A smart GitHub Action for automating issue management. This action automatically applies labels, assigns issues to the least busy team member, and manages stale issues.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automatic Labeling:** üè∑Ô∏è Applies labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, or `question` based on keywords found in the issue's title and body.

* **Intelligent Assignment:** üßë‚Äçüíª Assigns issues to a team member based on keywords. It intelligently picks the least busy assignee from a predefined list.

* **Stale Issue Management:** üï∞Ô∏è Automatically marks issues as stale after a period of inactivity and closes them if no action is taken.

* **Information Check:** ‚ùì Checks if an issue has sufficient details and adds a `needs more info` label if it appears to be lacking key information like "steps to reproduce".

To start using this action, create a workflow file in your repository at `.github/workflows/triage.yml`.
